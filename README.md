## Features
- **WYSIWYG Editor**: Penman provides a What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) editor, making it easy to format and style your README content.
- **Markdown Support**: If you prefer working with Markdown, Penman supports it as well. You can switch between the WYSIWYG editor and the Markdown source code at any time.
- **Live Preview**: See how your README will look on GitHub in real-time. No need to push changes to your repository before previewing.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Code blocks in your README will be automatically syntax-highlighted, making them more readable.
- **Custom Styles**: Customize the look of your README with your choice of fonts, colors, and styles.
- **Export and Save**: Save your README as a markdown file or HTML for later use, or directly commit it to your repository.
